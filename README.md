# Brisk Forms

Free HTML form submission service for static sites. Keep your email address private. Hosted at [briskforms.com](http://briskforms.com/).

Submit your form to our URL and we'll forward the contents to your email. No database, no scripting, no cost! Ideal for people wishing to implement a contact form without exposing your email address on static sites such as those created with Jekyll, Pelican, or Hakyll.

## Why?

Similar services all have the same problem: Your email address is exposed to would-be spammers, unless you pay them. Brisk Forms side steps this issue by providing you with a unique and secure URL to use in place of your email address.
